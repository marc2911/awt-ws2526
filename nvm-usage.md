## Usage

To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:

```sh
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
```

To install a specific version of node:

```sh
nvm install 14.7.0 # or 16.3.0, 12.22.1, etc
```

To set an alias:

```sh
nvm alias my_alias v14.4.0
```
Make sure that your alias does not contain any spaces or slashes.

The first version installed becomes the default. New shells will start with the default version of node (e.g., `nvm alias default`).

You can list available versions using `ls-remote`:

```sh
nvm ls-remote
```

And then in any new shell just use the installed version:

```sh
nvm use node
```

Or you can just run it:

```sh
nvm run node --version
```

Or, you can run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node:

```sh
nvm exec 4.2 node --version
```

You can also get the path to the executable to where it was installed:

```sh
nvm which 12.22
```

In place of a version pointer like "14.7" or "16.3" or "12.22.1", you can use the following special default aliases with `nvm install`, `nvm use`, `nvm run`, `nvm exec`, `nvm which`, etc:

  - `node`: this installs the latest version of [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - `iojs`: this installs the latest version of [`io.js`](https://iojs.org/en/)
  - `stable`: this alias is deprecated, and only truly applies to `node` `v0.12` and earlier. Currently, this is an alias for `node`.
  - `unstable`: this alias points to `node` `v0.11` - the last "unstable" node release, since post-1.0, all node versions are stable. (in SemVer, versions communicate breakage, not stability).

### Long-term Support

Node has a [schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) for long-term support (LTS) You can reference LTS versions in aliases and `.nvmrc` files with the notation `lts/*` for the latest LTS, and `lts/argon` for LTS releases from the "argon" line, for example. In addition, the following commands support LTS arguments:

  - `nvm install --lts` / `nvm install --lts=argon` / `nvm install 'lts/*'` / `nvm install lts/argon`
  - `nvm uninstall --lts` / `nvm uninstall --lts=argon` / `nvm uninstall 'lts/*'` / `nvm uninstall lts/argon`
  - `nvm use --lts` / `nvm use --lts=argon` / `nvm use 'lts/*'` / `nvm use lts/argon`
  - `nvm exec --lts` / `nvm exec --lts=argon` / `nvm exec 'lts/*'` / `nvm exec lts/argon`
  - `nvm run --lts` / `nvm run --lts=argon` / `nvm run 'lts/*'` / `nvm run lts/argon`
  - `nvm ls-remote --lts` / `nvm ls-remote --lts=argon` `nvm ls-remote 'lts/*'` / `nvm ls-remote lts/argon`
  - `nvm version-remote --lts` / `nvm version-remote --lts=argon` / `nvm version-remote 'lts/*'` / `nvm version-remote lts/argon`

Any time your local copy of `nvm` connects to https://nodejs.org, it will re-create the appropriate local aliases for all available LTS lines. These aliases (stored under `$NVM_DIR/alias/lts`), are managed by `nvm`, and you should not modify, remove, or create these files - expect your changes to be undone, and expect meddling with these files to cause bugs that will likely not be supported.

To get the latest LTS version of node and migrate your existing installed packages, use

```sh
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=current 'lts/*'
```

### Migrating Global Packages While Installing

If you want to install a new version of Node.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:

```sh
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=node node
```

This will first use "nvm version node" to identify the current version you're migrating packages from. Then it resolves the new version to install from the remote server and installs it. Lastly, it runs "nvm reinstall-packages" to reinstall the npm packages from your prior version of Node to the new one.

You can also install and migrate npm packages from specific versions of Node like this:

```sh
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=5 6
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=iojs v4.2
```

Note that reinstalling packages _explicitly does not update the npm version_ â€” this is to ensure that npm isn't accidentally upgraded to a broken version for the new node version.

To update npm at the same time add the `--latest-npm` flag, like this:

```sh
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=default --latest-npm 'lts/*'
```

or, you can at any time run the following command to get the latest supported npm version on the current node version:
```sh
nvm install-latest-npm
```

If you've already gotten an error to the effect of "npm does not support Node.js", you'll need to (1) revert to a previous node version (`nvm ls` & `nvm use <your latest _working_ version from the ls>`), (2) delete the newly created node version (`nvm uninstall <your _broken_ version of node from the ls>`), then (3) rerun your `nvm install` with the `--latest-npm` flag.


### Default Global Packages From File While Installing

If you have a list of default packages you want installed every time you install a new version, we support that too -- just add the package names, one per line, to the file `$NVM_DIR/default-packages`. You can add anything npm would accept as a package argument on the command line.

```sh
# $NVM_DIR/default-packages

rimraf
object-inspect@1.0.2
stevemao/left-pad
```

### io.js

If you want to install [io.js](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/):

```sh
nvm install iojs
```

If you want to install a new version of io.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:

```sh
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=iojs iojs
```

The same guidelines mentioned for migrating npm packages in node are applicable to io.js.

### System Version of Node

If you want to use the system-installed version of node, you can use the special default alias "system":

```sh
nvm use system
nvm run system --version
```

### Listing Versions

If you want to see what versions are installed:

```sh
nvm ls
```

If you want to see what versions are available to install:

```sh
nvm ls-remote
```

### Setting Custom Colors

You can set five colors that will be used to display version and alias information. These colors replace the default colors.
  Initial colors are: g b y r e

  Color codes:

    r/R = red / bold red

    g/G = green / bold green

    b/B = blue / bold blue

    c/C = cyan / bold cyan

    m/M = magenta / bold magenta

    y/Y = yellow / bold yellow

    k/K = black / bold black

    e/W = light grey / white

```sh
nvm set-colors rgBcm
```

#### Persisting custom colors

If you want the custom colors to persist after terminating the shell, export the `NVM_COLORS` variable in your shell profile. For example, if you want to use cyan, magenta, green, bold red and bold yellow, add the following line:

```sh
export NVM_COLORS='cmgRY'
```

#### Suppressing colorized output

`nvm help (or -h or --help)`, `nvm ls`, `nvm ls-remote` and `nvm alias` usually produce colorized output. You can disable colors with the `--no-colors` option (or by setting the environment variable `TERM=dumb`):

```sh
nvm ls --no-colors
nvm help --no-colors
TERM=dumb nvm ls
```

### Restoring PATH
To restore your PATH, you can deactivate it:

```sh
nvm deactivate
```

### Set default node version
To set a default Node version to be used in any new shell, use the alias 'default':

```sh
nvm alias default node # this refers to the latest installed version of node
nvm alias default 18 # this refers to the latest installed v18.x version of node
nvm alias default 18.12  # this refers to the latest installed v18.12.x version of node
```

### Use a mirror of node binaries
To use a mirror of the node binaries, set `$NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR`:

```sh
export NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist
nvm install node

NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist nvm install 4.2
```

To use a mirror of the io.js binaries, set `$NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR`:

```sh
export NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist
nvm install iojs-v1.0.3

NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist nvm install iojs-v1.0.3
```

`nvm use` will not, by default, create a "current" symlink. Set `$NVM_SYMLINK_CURRENT` to "true" to enable this behavior, which is sometimes useful for IDEs. Note that using `nvm` in multiple shell tabs with this environment variable enabled can cause race conditions.

#### Pass Authorization header to mirror
To pass an Authorization header through to the mirror url, set `$NVM_AUTH_HEADER`

```sh
NVM_AUTH_HEADER="Bearer secret-token" nvm install node
```

### .nvmrc

You can create a `.nvmrc` file containing a node version number (or any other string that `nvm` understands; see `nvm --help` for details) in the project root directory (or any parent directory).
Afterwards, `nvm use`, `nvm install`, `nvm exec`, `nvm run`, and `nvm which` will use the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file if no version is supplied on the command line.

For example, to make nvm default to the latest 5.9 release, the latest LTS version, or the latest node version for the current directory:

```sh
$ echo "5.9" > .nvmrc

$ echo "lts/*" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest LTS version

$ echo "node" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest version
```

[NB these examples assume a POSIX-compliant shell version of `echo`. If you use a Windows `cmd` development environment, eg the `.nvmrc` file is used to configure a remote Linux deployment, then keep in mind the `"`s will be copied leading to an invalid file. Remove them.]

Then when you run nvm use:

```sh
$ nvm use
Found '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version <5.9>
Now using node v5.9.1 (npm v3.7.3)
```

Running nvm install will also switch over to the correct version, but if the correct node version isn't already installed, it will install it for you.

```sh
$ nvm install
Found '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version <5.9>
Downloading and installing node v5.9.1...
Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v5.9.1/node-v5.9.1-linux-x64.tar.xz...
#################################################################################### 100.0%
Computing checksum with sha256sum
Checksums matched!
Now using node v5.9.1 (npm v3.7.3)
```

`nvm use` et. al. will traverse directory structure upwards from the current directory looking for the `.nvmrc` file. In other words, running `nvm use` et. al. in any subdirectory of a directory with an `.nvmrc` will result in that `.nvmrc` being utilized.

The contents of a `.nvmrc` file **must** contain precisely one `<version>` (as described by `nvm --help`) followed by a newline. `.nvmrc` files may also have comments. The comment delimiter is `#`, and it and any text after it, as well as blank lines, and leading and trailing white space, will be ignored when parsing.

Key/value pairs using `=` are also allowed and ignored, but are reserved for future use, and may cause validation errors in the future.

Run [`npx nvmrc`](https://npmjs.com/nvmrc) to validate an `.nvmrc` file. If that toolâ€™s results do not agree with nvm, one or the other has a bug - please file an issue.

### Deeper Shell Integration

You can use [`nvshim`](https://github.com/iamogbz/nvshim) to shim the `node`, `npm`, and `npx` bins to automatically use the `nvm` config in the current directory. `nvshim` is **not** supported by the `nvm` maintainers. Please [report issues to the `nvshim` team](https://github.com/iamogbz/nvshim/issues/new).

If you prefer a lighter-weight solution, the recipes below have been contributed by `nvm` users. They are **not** supported by the `nvm` maintainers. We are, however, accepting pull requests for more examples.

#### Calling `nvm use` automatically in a directory with a `.nvmrc` file

In your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`), add the following to `nvm use` whenever you enter a new directory:

##### bash

Put the following at the end of your `$HOME/.bashrc`:

```bash
cdnvm() {
    command cd "$@" || return $?
    nvm_path="$(nvm_find_up .nvmrc | command tr -d '\n')"

    # If there are no .nvmrc file, use the default nvm version
    if [[ ! $nvm_path = *[^[:space:]]* ]]; then

        declare default_version
        default_version="$(nvm version default)"

        # If there is no default version, set it to `node`
        # This will use the latest version on your machine
        if [ $default_version = 'N/A' ]; then
            nvm alias default node
            default_version=$(nvm version default)
        fi

        # If the current version is not the default version, set it to use the default version
        if [ "$(nvm current)" != "${default_version}" ]; then
            nvm use default
        fi
    elif [[ -s "${nvm_path}/.nvmrc" && -r "${nvm_path}/.nvmrc" ]]; then
        declare nvm_version
        nvm_version=$(<"${nvm_path}"/.nvmrc)

        declare locally_resolved_nvm_version
        # `nvm ls` will check all locally-available versions
        # If there are multiple matching versions, take the latest one
        # Remove the `->` and `*` characters and spaces
        # `locally_resolved_nvm_version` will be `N/A` if no local versions are found
        locally_resolved_nvm_version=$(nvm ls --no-colors "${nvm_version}" | command tail -1 | command tr -d '\->*' | command tr -d '[:space:]')

        # If it is not already installed, install it
        # `nvm install` will implicitly use the newly-installed version
        if [ "${locally_resolved_nvm_version}" = 'N/A' ]; then
            nvm install "${nvm_version}";
        elif [ "$(nvm current)" != "${locally_resolved_nvm_version}" ]; then
            nvm use "${nvm_version}";
        fi
    fi
}

alias cd='cdnvm'
cdnvm "$PWD" || exit
```

This alias would search 'up' from your current directory in order to detect a `.nvmrc` file. If it finds it, it will switch to that version; if not, it will use the default version.

##### zsh

This shell function will install (if needed) and `nvm use` the specified Node version when an `.nvmrc` is found, and `nvm use default` otherwise.

Put this into your `$HOME/.zshrc` to call `nvm use` automatically whenever you enter a directory that contains an
`.nvmrc` file with a string telling nvm which node to `use`:

```zsh
# place this after nvm initialization!
autoload -U add-zsh-hook

load-nvmrc() {
  local nvmrc_path
  nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"

  if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then
    local nvmrc_node_version
    nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")

    if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then
      nvm install
    elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$(nvm version)" ]; then
      nvm use
    fi
  elif [ -n "$(PWD=$OLDPWD nvm_find_nvmrc)" ] && [ "$(nvm version)" != "$(nvm version default)" ]; then
    echo "Reverting to nvm default version"
    nvm use default
  fi
}

add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
load-nvmrc
```

After saving the file, run `source ~/.zshrc` to reload the configuration with the latest changes made.

##### fish

This requires that you have [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) installed.
```fish
# ~/.config/fish/functions/nvm.fish
function nvm
  bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm $argv
end

# ~/.config/fish/functions/nvm_find_nvmrc.fish
function nvm_find_nvmrc
  bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm_find_nvmrc
end

# ~/.config/fish/functions/load_nvm.fish
function load_nvm --on-variable="PWD"
  set -l default_node_version (nvm version default)
  set -l node_version (nvm version)
  set -l nvmrc_path (nvm_find_nvmrc)
  if test -n "$nvmrc_path"
    set -l nvmrc_node_version (nvm version (cat $nvmrc_path))
    if test "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A"
      nvm install (cat $nvmrc_path)
    else if test "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$node_version"
      nvm use $nvmrc_node_version
    end
  else if test "$node_version" != "$default_node_version"
    echo "Reverting to default Node version"
    nvm use default
  end
end

# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
# You must call it on initialization or listening to directory switching won't work
load_nvm > /dev/stderr
```
